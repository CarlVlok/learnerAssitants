This project was created to assist myself when I study, since I dont want to search through a bunch of powerpoint slides, that will eat up my 
computers resources, slow down my system, and it just takes to long to search for things.

For BBIS stundets reading this, all files for Year 1 Semester 2 are uploaded (as at 3/09/2025)

Requirements:
- Gemini API key, stored in .env
- pip: pptx, google, dotenv, pydantic
