question: What do void methods do?
answer: Void methods in Java do not return any value. Their primary purpose is to perform actions, such as printing output to the console or modifying the state of data. They are invoked as a standalone statement on their own line.
question: And how are void methods different to value methods?
answer: Void methods do not return a value and are primarily used to perform an action, such as printing output or modifying data. They are invoked on their own line as a standalone statement. In contrast, value methods declare a specific return type and must use at least one return statement to provide a value. The value returned by a value method must be handled, typically by assigning it to a variable or using it as part of a larger expression.
question: Exit
answer: In Java programming, exiting refers to the termination of a block of code or a program. The `return` statement is used to terminate a method's execution before it reaches its end, returning control to the caller. For example, in error handling, a `return;` statement can immediately exit a method if an invalid condition is met. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop immediately when encountered, often based on a specific condition within the loop body. The `continue` statement, while not exiting the entire loop, skips the current iteration and moves directly to the next one. The provided context does not explicitly detail a general program exit mechanism like `System.exit()`.
