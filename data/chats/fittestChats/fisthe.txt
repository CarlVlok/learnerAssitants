question: What is the difference between software engineering and computer science?
answer: Computer Science (CS) is a field of study that focuses on the theory and design of computers and algorithms. It encompasses areas like algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and understanding how computer hardware components function together. Software Engineering (SE), on the other hand, is a sub-section of Computer Science that applies engineering principles and best practices to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. While CS focuses on the fundamental concepts and theories, SE is concerned with the practical application of these principles to build reliable and efficient software solutions for end users, often utilizing structured approaches like the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) or Agile methodologies.
question: What is IT?
answer: Information Technology (IT) can be viewed as the use of computers to make humans more productive in their daily and working lives by allowing them to create, store, process, and retrieve information.
