question: Give an example of using the Grant statement
answer: The `GRANT` statement in SQL is used for managing permissions within a relational database. It is one of the key operations for controlling who can access and manipulate data or schema elements. While the provided context does not offer a specific example query for `GRANT`, its role is to define and assign user privileges.
