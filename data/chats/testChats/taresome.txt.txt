question: Give me an example of a create table statement
answer: A `CREATE TABLE` statement is used in SQL to define a new table in your database schema. It specifies the table's name, its columns, and the data type for each column, along with any constraints like a primary key.

Here's a common example for creating a `Students` table, based on the concepts of entities and attributes discussed in data modeling:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Age INT
);
```

In this example:
*   `CREATE TABLE Students` initiates the creation of a new table named `Students`.
*   `StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY` defines a column named `StudentID` with an integer data type, designated as the primary key. This ensures each student has a unique identifier.
*   `Name VARCHAR(255)` defines a `Name` column that can store variable-length strings up to 255 characters.
*   `Age INT` defines an `Age` column that stores integer values.
