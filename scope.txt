Idea: 
A app that allows its users to give an agent any piece of content that they are currently studying, 
even allowing them to give the agent e.g. an entire textbook, but onl yasking for a lesson on a specific topic

Input:
The user gives the agent data (pdf, word, powerpoint, videos, excel)

Output
- A podcast like audio that lectures teh user on teh certain topic
- Being able to ask teh bot something about a topic
- Stop bot halfway through to ask question

Breakdown:
- Due to token limits, split each doc into specific chunks, to minimize the amount of content needed to be processed by gpt

Step 1:
- Find a way to split pdf, docx, powerpoint
- Sample data for experimentation:
    - Man152 content
    - Change content names to relative topics
